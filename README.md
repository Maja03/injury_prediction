## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Player Statistics**: Performance metrics, playing time, games played
- **Historical Injury Records**: Previous injury patterns and severity
- **Physical Metrics**: Age, height, weight, BMI, FIFA ratings
- **Positional Data**: Player position, work rate, nationality

### Machine Learning Approach
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regression
- **Preprocessing**: Median imputation for missing values
- **Feature Engineering**: 99 engineered features from raw data
- **Validation**: 80/20 train-test split with cross-validation

### Key Variables
- Previous injury history (`cumulative_days_injured`, `avg_days_injured_prev_seasons`)
- Playing time metrics (`season_minutes_played`, `total_minutes_played`)
- Physical attributes (`age`, `height_cm`, `weight_kg`, `bmi`)
- Positional data (`position_numeric`, `work_rate_numeric`)
- Performance indicators (`fifa_rating`, `pace`, `physic`)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The system provides comprehensive evaluation through:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Overall prediction accuracy
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Interpretable error measure
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average prediction error
- **R-squared (R²)**: Proportion of variance explained
- **Cross-Validation Scores**: Robustness assessment

## 🎨 Visualizations

The system generates comprehensive visualizations:

1. **Actual vs. Predicted Scatter Plot**: Model performance visualization
2. **Residuals Distribution**: Error pattern analysis
3. **Feature Importance Rankings**: Most influential factors
4. **Prediction Error Analysis**: Systematic bias detection

## 🎓 Thesis Context

This system exemplifies the integration of open football data with advanced AI methodologies, creating a novel decision support tool for sports professionals. It demonstrates how publicly available data can be transformed into actionable insights for athlete health and performance optimization.

The moderate predictive power (R² = 0.46) aligns with the complexity of injury prediction in professional sports, where multiple factors interact in non-linear ways. The system's interpretability through feature importance rankings provides valuable insights for sports medicine professionals.

## 📞 Usage Examples

### Individual Player Prediction
```python
from injury_prediction_app import InjuryPredictionSystem

# Initialize system
system = InjuryPredictionSystem()

# Predict for specific player
player_data = {
    'age': 25,
    'height_cm': 180,
    'weight_kg': 75,
    'cumulative_days_injured': 30,
    # ... other features
}

prediction = system.predict_injury_risk(player_data)
print(f"Predicted injury days: {prediction['predicted_injury_days']}")
print(f"Risk level: {prediction['risk_level']}")
```

### System Evaluation
```python
# Generate comprehensive report
report = system.generate_system_report()

# Create visualizations
system.create_evaluation_visualizations()

# Get feature importance
importance = system.get_feature_importance(top_n=10)
```
