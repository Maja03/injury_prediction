# AI-Based Athlete Injury Prediction System Using Open Football Data

## 🏥 Overview

This thesis project develops an AI-based system capable of predicting injury risk and severity among professional football players, leveraging openly available football datasets. The system applies supervised machine learning algorithms to model complex relationships between player attributes and injury outcomes.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🖥️ Interactive Web Application
- **Dynamic Player Search**: Search and select any player from the database
- **Real-time Risk Analysis**: Instant injury risk predictions with detailed explanations
- **Interactive Charts**: Feature importance charts and risk distribution visualizations
- **Player-Specific Reports**: Comprehensive individual player analysis pages
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### 🤖 AI Prediction Engine
- **Dual Gradient-Boosted Pipelines**: Regression estimates injury days while classification estimates the probability of missing ≥30 days
- **Season-Aware Validation**: Rolling-origin splits by `start_year` reproduce longitudinal studies (Martins et al., 2025)
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP explanations expose biomechanical factors per player (Calderón-Díaz et al., 2024)
- **Comprehensive Model Evaluation**: Regression + classification metrics, decision curves, and conformal-style intervals
- **Open Data Integration**: Built on publicly accessible football datasets with four-season coverage
- **Decision Support Hooks**: Configurable thresholds for medical and performance staff

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Algorithms**: HistGradientBoosting Regressor (injury days) + HistGradientBoosting Classifier (≥30-day injury flag)
- **Validation**: Rolling-origin (train on seasons 1..n-1, test on season n) to respect temporal drift
- **Stored Metrics**: `models/metadata.json` captures R², MSE, MAE, ROC-AUC, average precision, recall, and residual quantiles after training
- **Decision Analytics**: `models/decision_curve_data.csv` summarises bench/play trade-offs for multiple probability & day thresholds
- **Explainability**: Player-level SHAP attributions surface biomechanical/workload drivers directly in the UI

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Player Statistics**: Performance metrics, playing time, games played
- **Historical Injury Records**: Previous injury patterns and severity
- **Physical Metrics**: Age, height, weight, BMI, FIFA ratings
- **Positional Data**: Player position, work rate, nationality

### Machine Learning Approach
- **Algorithms**: HistGradientBoosting regression for `season_days_injured` + HistGradientBoosting classification for ≥30-day injury indicator
- **Preprocessing**: ColumnTransformer with median-imputed numeric features and one-hot encoded categoricals
- **Feature Set**: 99 attributes spanning history, workload, biomechanics, and demographics (see `metadata.json`)
- **Validation**: Rolling-origin evaluation across seasons, aligned with Majumdar et al. (2024) and Martins et al. (2025)
- **Calibration**: Absolute residual quantiles provide conformal-style intervals; class weights mitigate imbalance

### Key Variables
- Previous injury history (`cumulative_days_injured`, `avg_days_injured_prev_seasons`)
- Training load and availability (`season_minutes_played`, `matches_played`)
- Physical/biomechanical markers (`age`, `height_cm`, `weight_kg`, `bmi`)
- Position & role descriptors (`position_numeric`, `work_rate_numeric`)
- Performance indicators (`fifa_rating`, `pace`, `physic`)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

After running the training script, consult `models/metadata.json` for:

- **Regression**: MSE, MAE, R², residual quantiles (q50/80/90/95)
- **Classification**: Precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, average precision
- **Decision Curves**: Share of flagged players vs. mean true injury days per threshold

## 🎨 Visualizations

The system generates comprehensive visualizations:

1. **Actual vs. Predicted Scatter Plot**: Model performance visualization
2. **Residuals Distribution**: Error pattern analysis
3. **Feature Importance Rankings**: Most influential factors
4. **Prediction Error Analysis**: Systematic bias detection

## 🔍 Explainability

Calderón-Díaz et al. (2024) emphasise transparent biomechanical signals, so the app surfaces:

- **Per-Player SHAP Contributions**: Top 10 drivers for every prediction
- **Team-Level Risk Mix**: Aggregates both predicted days and injury probabilities
- **Manual Overrides**: Document adjustments for exogenous events while logging reasons

## 🏆 Research Contributions

- Longitudinal gradient-boosted approach extends Martins et al. (2025) with multi-season open data
- Explainable biomechanical analysis mirrors Calderón-Díaz et al. (2024)

## 📚 Technical Details

### Model Architecture
```python
preprocess = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', Pipeline([('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median'))]), numeric_cols),
        ('cat', Pipeline([
            ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
            ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
        ]), categorical_cols)
    ]
)

regression_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocess', preprocess),
    ('model', LGBMRegressor(n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.05,
                            subsample=0.9, colsample_bytree=0.9,
                            random_state=42))
])

classification_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocess', preprocess),
    ('model', LGBMClassifier(n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.05,
                             subsample=0.9, colsample_bytree=0.9,
                             class_weight='balanced',
                             random_state=42))
])
```

### Data Processing
- **Missing Value Handling**: Median (numeric) / most frequent (categorical)
- **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot via ColumnTransformer
- **Targets**: `season_days_injured` (continuous) + binary flag (`>=30` days)

## 🎓 Thesis Context

This system exemplifies the integration of open football data with longitudinal, research-backed ML workflows. It demonstrates how publicly available multi-season records can be transformed into actionable insights for athlete health and workload management.

Performance varies by dataset composition; after each training run consult `models/metadata.json` for contemporary regression and classification metrics. Consistent with prior literature, moderate R² / ROC-AUC values reflect the inherent complexity of injury forecasting, which is why explainability, calibration, and decision curves accompany every prediction.

## 📞 Usage Examples

### Individual Player Prediction
```python
from injury_prediction_app import InjuryPredictionSystem

# Initialize system
system = InjuryPredictionSystem()

# Predict for specific player
player_data = {
    'age': 25,
    'height_cm': 180,
    'weight_kg': 75,
    'cumulative_days_injured': 30,
    # ... other features
}

prediction = system.predict_injury_risk(player_data)
print(f"Predicted injury days: {prediction['predicted_injury_days']}")
print(f"Risk level: {prediction['risk_level']}")
```

### System Evaluation
```python
# Generate comprehensive report
report = system.generate_system_report()

# Create visualizations
system.create_evaluation_visualizations()

# Get feature importance
importance = system.get_feature_importance(top_n=10)
```
